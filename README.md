A combonation of bootstrap, google, and information we learned in class led to the code in my assignment.

//Ashur Nanno: most of the page look very nice; however, the "Our Room" containe doesnt match the mockup and the image size is different the the header of that container; the resposivnes of the page looks good; the navbar though is not minimizing. also the 3 imags in the "welcome to hamster.." section sizes are not the same. well done in making such a page design in less than a month learning html, css, and bootstrap and other tools. Also the "Amnities" section the icons sizes are not the same.
